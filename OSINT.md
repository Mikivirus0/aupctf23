## Challenge Name: Records
Our website has been hacked, and the attackers have hidden a flag in an unexpected location in a txt. To find the flag, you'll need to look beyond the usual pages and directories on our website. Keep in mind that the attackers may have used clever tricks to hide the flag, so you'll need to be creative in your search. Remember, the flag may be hiding in plain sight, but you'll need to know where to look. Good luck!
