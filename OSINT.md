## Challenge Name: Records
Our website has been hacked, and the attackers have hidden a flag in an unexpected location in a txt. To find the flag, you'll need to look beyond the usual pages and directories on our website. Keep in mind that the attackers may have used clever tricks to hide the flag, so you'll need to be creative in your search. Remember, the flag may be hiding in plain sight, but you'll need to know where to look. Good luck!

## Challenge Name: Don't copyvo me
I love Wikipedia because it's free and open source to view - but I also hate it because people can remove content if they think it's a "copyright violation" - even if it's not. Our University kept having that happen to us - but thankfully our page looks pretty great right now!
Can you tell me who kept doing that to the university and the total bytes of data they deleted? Don't use any commas.
## Sol:
This was easy, i just visited wikipedia and searched for "copy" and got the answer. (Because Copyvo was Tittle of Chall)

## Challenge Name: About-Face
I'd love to work for a social media company when they're just starting out. Imagine getting a job at thefacebook, I mean facebook, I mean Meta - whatever they want to go by these days, way back when?
Come to think of it, dropping the from their name was probably the smartest idea they ever had. My uncle said he applied for a role with their Network Operations team after he heard that they dropped 'the' from their name, but never heard back and thinks it's because the person he emailed left their job.
I don't believe him, but he told me I can always reach out to the person he emailed to confirm. I doubt they still work there, but can you tell me the role he applied for and the first name of the person he reached out to? He said it should be easy to figure out - that team had only one role available that year and he applied before December.

## Sol:
Well after alot of research i got right thing from:
